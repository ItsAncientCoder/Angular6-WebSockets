1. Open a command prompt and run 
    'npm install' and 'ng serve --open'
2. Open another command prompt and run 'node server.js'

3. If you are integrating this code into your project, don't forget to include 
    ' (window as any).global = window; ' in 'src/polyfills.ts'. else this code will not run in your project. 
    
    

Happy Coding.
